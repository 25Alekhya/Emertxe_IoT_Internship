# Emertxe_IoT_Project
During the internship, I worked on an 'IoT-Based Home Automation Solution' project. This project focused on controlling and monitoring essential home appliances, including garden lights, a temperature control system, and the inlet and outlet valves of a water tank and developed using the Blynk IoT app and simulated with the PicSimLab Simulator.
