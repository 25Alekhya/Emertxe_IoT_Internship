# Emertxe_IoT_Project
During the internship, I worked on an 'IoT-Based Home Automation Solution' project. This project focused on controlling and monitoring essential home appliances, including garden lights, a temperature control system, and the inlet and outlet valves of a water tank and developed using the Blynk IoT app and simulated with the PicSimLab Simulator.

Home Automation Project Overview:
Garden Lights Automation: Controlled using an LDR sensor.
Temperature Conditioner: Monitored and displayed on a dashboard.
Water Tank Automation: Managed with a set of predefined instructions.

Tools Utilized:
Arduino IDE: Used for coding the project.
PicSimLab Simulator: Simulated the Arduino Uno board.
Blynk IoT Application: Enabled IoT-based control and monitoring.
